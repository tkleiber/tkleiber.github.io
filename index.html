<p>We try to be agile in developing and merging our features into branches when they are ready for use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Test Driven Development is on everyone&#8217;s lips with Java and other languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether we develop ADF or JET or Spring, we try to apply these techniques in many places.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what is the real basis of most of our applications?
This is the Oracle database with its data model and programming language PL/SQL!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again and again we hear that merging data model scripts and PL/SQL programs is not practicable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But how are we supposed to develop our frontend according to these techniques, if we don&#8217;t start with it in the backend?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the lecture and the demo&#8217;s I will show you how you can further develop your data model and your programs in the database agile and test driven from requirement till refactoring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see how tools like Git, Liquibase, utPLSQL and Jenkins work together.</p>

<p>Today my presentation is confirmed: "Regulatorics: Offside is when the referee whistles". Maybe the German title will be better understood: "Regulatorik: Abseits ist, wenn der Schiedsrichter pfeift".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The regulatory system has more and more influence on our software development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regulatory authorities, external and internal Auditors are increasingly examining our IT and not longer only our business processes and balance sheets.
Some of them have better trained IT experts as we can find on the free market.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>General standards such as ISO/IEC 2700X but also banking-specific standards such as BAIT and MaRisk now pose challenges that generally only large software manufacturers know.
Approximately 40 % of our projects are now regulatory-driven.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, we are currently redefining our development process in order to implement the following requirements, among others
* Unchangeability of the tested artefacts after the test
* Functional segregation
* Detection of accidental changes or intentional manipulations of the application</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lecture shows the vision of such a safe process. It shows the current status of implementation in SOA and ADF development, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Migration of version management to GIT in Atlassian BitBucket</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application and selection criteria for a branching model
* Mandatory code reviews in Atlassian BitBucket</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build and Deployment Pipelines in Jenkins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic documentation in JIRA Issue via Bitbucket and Jenkins.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maybe you too can minimize the additional work and continue to work agile to meet such requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you speak german and you are interested in some of this, you should come and attend DOAG 2018.</p>

<p>After several presentations about ADF and the related development life cycle I decided this year to speak about the selection process of a PL/SQL testing tool. Additional I <a href="../2016/DOAG2016+wrap+up.html">promised</a> to do some of this last year. The room was packed with round about 100 people, which I unfortunately never reached with ADF in the past. Despite some technical problems when starting and in the demo&#8217;s all went fine and I will thank again all my attendees.

<p>I see already a similar presentation from Elmar Juergens at <a href="Javaland+2017+wrap+up.html">Javaland 2017</a>. Same message this time. Additional he recommend to measure at first only the changed source code via a diffing algorithm to only identifying the changed lines. Most tools can&#8217;t do this. Will have a look at his own tool sometime. Additional our bosses want Elmar Juergens for a presentation for our developers. Will look if this will change their minds an they will look a least a bit more at the existing measured violation.</p>

<p>First at the beginning the decision was made, who of the both is pro and who is contra. Nice format to find the arguments for this. I&#8217;ve learned that all databases in the same virtualization farm has to be the same license and options, if you want not to pay to much. Additional it&#8217;s not usual to begin if you have fewer than 100 database instances.</p>

<p>Bryn shows here a security model for how accessing the data via an secure API which contains of 4 schema layers: data, code, implementation, API. Unfortunately this is not really good handled by some of Oracle own development frameworks like ADF despite you develop only on the rest API on top. But definitely give it a try.</p>

<p>The paintings was good but the rest was very esoteric presentation of philosophic messages. I think I was to inspired by the vita of mr. Botta when selected this slot, this was not what I had expected.</p>

<p>Before the evening keynote <a href="https://www.doag.org/de/home/news/ulrike-schwinn-wird-doag-botschafterin-fuer-technologien/detail/">Ulrike Schwinn</a> was awarded, congratulations! Over my career I heard a lot of presentations from her, which was impressive, none where I&#8217;m not learned something new.</p>

<p>Good and provocative but unfortunately in my opinion also with some mistakes. The law of moore does not <a href="http://www.giga.de/extra/ratgeber/specials/mooresches-gesetz-defintion-und-ende-von-moore-s-law-einfach-erklaert">apply anymore</a>, and this was his main explanation, why all will be automated in the near future. Yes automation will happen, but only where a real business case is. If you see that over 50% of internet traffic <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/6/8/15757594/future-internet-traffic-watch-live-video-facebook-google-netflix">is eaten by video streaming</a> already, than I think this will hamper this process. Blockchain is not an oprating system, it is an distributed secure database. But it comes with cost, which actually is not paid, for example: <a href="https://t.co/27I0iozvCj">A Bitcoin transaction consumes more electricity than a one-person household per month</a>. And the verification of security need to many time. This has to be solved or Blockchain will only be used productive in edge case. Generally I&#8217;m more a fan of <a href="https://twitter.com/wilddueck">WildDueck</a>.</p>

<h3 id="adf_community_meeting">ADF Community Meeting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately this was the greatest disappointment of the whole DOAG conference for me. <a href="../2016/DOAG2016+wrap+up.html">Once again</a> we discussed several things</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>ADF is not visible from Oracle because not actually marketed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Errors in JDeveloper: the IDE for ADF and lack of support for this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide an Virtual Machine for ADF development. This is ok for trying out, but will not supported in restricted environment at customers as at my company - a bank. At least this should not be an replacement of support for JDeveloper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should we open the community to other technologies like SOA, JET, ABCS an so on. My opinion: definitely no, as this is the final dead of ADF in the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We see that some of the important product managers move to JET and does not support us anymore.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In this atmosphere this year no common dinner happens after the meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After that I spent the time with some colleagues at the evening party. This year I see early clearing the rooms of the NCC. I don&#8217;t know if the starting Scope alliance party was the cause, but maybe they will do this next year on the first day instead?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the moment I define a future proof build and deployment process at my company for the loan platform. Part of this is security and mandatory review. So the presented Forms API Master tool is the perfect tool for handling the review and merge process of branches for our legacy Forms and Reports development. Will look how to implement this in Atlassian BitBucket.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not really new for us, but as we speak a lot with other colleagues from his company the solutions are mostly known for us - and for the whole ADF community in Germany. Interesting is the decision to implement batch processing in Java too, seems that it is problematic to get PL/SQL staff right now. I&#8217;m not understanding the decision to write an own framework for database deployment, but as this was not his own topic, he could not answer why Liquibase or Flyway does not fulfill their requirements.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I missed Franks sessions last years, but often look at his slides in the web. This was a very good entry in differentiating the different Oracle Cloud Services, which I could use for Java Development. Oracle Java Cloud Service is only one of it and should correctly named Oracle WebLogic Cloud Service. Great another naming dropping: Application Container Cloud should better by named as Language as a Service. Look at the slides to get the whole picture.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best example that you can learn ever something new from a good presenter, despite you think you know all about a topic and you have already read the presentation before. For an example: a regular expression looks already for the longest possible match, which could be the whole string instead of the searched pattern. Interesting too the connect by regexp_count for splitting a string into rows. And look at the standard patterns in dbms_redact before you write your own, if it is not there write it in your own package for reuse.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second presentation of Frank I attend compares the actual available Runtimes on the market. But special interesting was the intro into micro services: are you sure you need this and do you know, what nobody tells you about latency and so on? Or do you know that accessing another micro service can need 100000 times more than accessing a functionality in the same monolith?</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again this year I attend colorful bouquet of presentations and again it pay&#8217;s off to look at the whole conference program and some abstracts and presentations before to minimize disappointments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally I attend to few development sessions, maybe because I use other technologies or know already the presented topic. But my feeling is that there are really fewer development presentations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interesting is that finally many Development, Deployment, QA, TDD and CI/CD technologies used in other development languages find it&#8217;s way into classic Oracle development technologies like Oracle PL/SQL, Forms and Reports.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the event organization I see a little degradation of service this year, for example the quality of the food or the cleaning of toilets and rooms. And a no go: Missing water for presenters in some rooms!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s it!</p>
